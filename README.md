# 🚦 ParkPulse — Parking Enforcement Intelligence for Bengaluru

**Gridlock Hackathon 2.0 · Round 2 Prototype · Theme 1 — Poor Visibility on Parking-Induced Congestion**

> 🔴 **Live demo:** https://flipkart-gridlock-20-r2-rinxb9yibzp8knp6quhfew.streamlit.app

ParkPulse turns **298,445 real BTP parking-violation records** (Nov 2023 – Apr 2024) into a
decision-support tool that tells Bengaluru Traffic Police **where** illegal parking chokes traffic,
**how much** each hotspot matters, **when** violations will recur, and **how** to deploy limited
patrol teams for maximum impact.

It is not a static dashboard — it is a closed loop: **detect → score → forecast → deploy → target.**

> 📖 **Full solution write-up — the idea, logic and algorithms behind every module (for the team *and* the judges):** see **[SOLUTION.md](SOLUTION.md)**. For a from-scratch walkthrough + judge-Q&A prep (to present and defend it), see **[WALKTHROUGH.md](WALKTHROUGH.md)**.

## What it does (4 modules)

| Page | Capability |
|---|---|
| **Command Center** | City-wide 3-D hotspot map, KPIs, and the enforcement-coverage *blind-spot* insight |
| **Hotspot Explorer** | Slice 298K records live by time / weekday / violation type / police station; hotspots re-rank instantly |
| **Forecast & Patrol Planner** | Predicts enforcement load per *zone × weekday × hour* and auto-generates a spatially-spread deployment plan for *N* teams |
| **Repeat-Offender Intelligence** | Surfaces the chronic 15% of vehicles responsible for ~34% of violations |

**Congestion Impact Score (0–100):** `violations × avg_severity × flow_multiplier`, where the flow
multiplier rewards junction-proximity and main-road blocking. Transparent and monotone by design.

**Forecast:** Bayesian-shrunk historical rates per zone×weekday×hour; sparse weekday cells borrow
strength from the zone's overall hour profile. Validated by an honest time-split backtest
(train on the first 80% of the calendar, predict the held-out tail) → **Pearson r ≈ 0.69**.

**Honesty note:** the timestamps record *when enforcement happened* (patrols are morning-heavy), not
ground-truth parking demand. We treat this explicitly — optimising **enforcement efficiency** on the
observed signal and flagging evening **coverage blind spots** rather than over-claiming.

## Run it locally

```bash
# 1. install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. build the cleaned data layer from the raw CSV
#    (expects: "dataset theme 1/jan to may police violation_anonymized*.csv")
python app/prep.py

# 3. launch
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Then open **http://localhost:8501**.

> If `data/clean.pkl` is already present (shipped in the source bundle), skip step 2.

```

`python app/core.py` runs a standalone smoke test of the intelligence layer (zones, backtest, sample patrol plan).
