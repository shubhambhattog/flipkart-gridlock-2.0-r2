## 1. The 60-second version

> **The problem:** Illegal parking chokes Bengaluru's busiest roads, and the Traffic Police enforce it
> *reactively* — officers go on instinct, with no city-wide picture of where parking actually hurts traffic
> or when.
>
> **What we built:** ParkPulse, a decision system that reads the Traffic Police's own 298,000 parking-violation
> records and answers four questions they can't answer today — **where** are the worst hotspots, **how much**
> does each one hurt traffic, **when** will violations recur, and **how** should we deploy our limited patrol
> teams. It even hands them a downloadable patrol plan and a list of the chronic repeat offenders.
>
> **Why it matters:** It turns reactive, instinct-based enforcement into proactive, data-driven enforcement —
> using only data they already collect, running on a laptop, deployed live today.

**Your north-star sentence (say it twice — open and close):**
> *"ParkPulse turns 298,000 rows of what already happened into where to stand tomorrow."*

### Proven impact (lead with this — it's the difference between a demo and a tool)
We didn't just build it — we **proved it on data the model never saw**. In a counterfactual replay over
**31 held-out days**, a **10-team ParkPulse plan would have been positioned for ~38% of the violations actually
logged**, versus ~1.3% for teams spread evenly across the city. Honest framing: that's the share of
*catchable/logged* violations (enforcement efficiency, not true demand) — but it's real evidence that the
forecaster + optimiser put teams where the action is, with timing and a ready-to-deploy plan a static heatmap
can't give you.

---

## 2. The story — how we got here

Tell this; it shows the judges you made deliberate, evidence-based choices.

- **Round 1** was an ML challenge: forecast traffic demand across a city from spatio-temporal data. We built
  a strong forecasting pipeline (geohash zones, time-of-day curves, lag features) and scored **91.14**.
- **Round 2** is the prototype phase — judged by *you*, the BTP + Flipkart panel, on feasibility, innovation,
  and real-world impact. We had to pick **one of three themes**.
- **We analysed all three datasets before choosing:**
  - *Theme 2 (event-driven congestion):* the dataset was thin — ~8,000 rows, mostly vehicle breakdowns, only
    ~191 actual planned events, and **no traffic-impact measurement** to forecast against. It couldn't support
    its own problem statement.
  - *Theme 3 (CV for violations):* a commoditised space (every team submits a YOLO helmet detector) and not
    our strength.
  - *Theme 1 (parking congestion):* **298,445 rich, clean records** — and it let us reuse our Round-1
    forecasting edge. Clear winner.
- So **ParkPulse is Theme 1**, and it deliberately plays to what we're best at: spatio-temporal intelligence.

**Takeaway line for judges:** *"We didn't pick the flashiest theme — we picked the one where the data was real
and where we could build something that actually deploys."*

---

## 3. Understanding the data from scratch

### What the dataset is
Real **Bengaluru Traffic Police parking-violation e-challan records**, Nov 2023 → Apr 2024 (150 days).
After cleaning: **298,445 violations**, about **1,990 per day**, with **zero missing values** on every field
we use.

### The fields that matter
| Field | What it is | How we use it |
|---|---|---|
| `latitude`, `longitude` | exact spot of the violation | map it; group into zones |
| `violation_type` | a list, e.g. `["WRONG PARKING","NO PARKING"]` | derive a **flow-severity** weight |
| `created_datetime` | when the ticket was logged | time-of-day / weekday patterns; forecasting |
| `vehicle_number` | anonymised plate token (e.g. `FKN…`) | repeat-offender detection |
| `police_station`, `junction_name` | which division / named junction | human-readable zone labels |

### The three patterns we found (and lean on)
1. **Hotspots are extremely concentrated** — the top **1%** of ~100 m locations hold **33%** of *all*
   violations. So a small number of places matter enormously → enforcement *should* be targeted.
2. **A chronic minority dominates** — **15%** of vehicles cause **34%** of violations. → a short, high-value
   target list exists.
3. **Strong, learnable time structure** — clear weekday and hour-of-day rhythms → violations are *forecastable*.

### ⭐ The one insight that makes us credible (don't skip this)
The data records **when an officer wrote a ticket — not when illegal parking actually happens.** Enforcement
is morning-heavy: **~93% of violations are logged before 1 PM**, and **under 0.3%** in the 5–9 PM evening peak.

So the data is **observation-biased**. We handle this *honestly*, and it's a strength, not a weakness:
- We **optimise enforcement efficiency** on the patterns we can observe (catch more with the same teams),
- and we **flag the blind spots** (evenings) where parking surely happens but patrols don't go.

> Say to judges: *"This is your enforcement data, so it shows where you already look. We don't pretend it's
> ground-truth demand — we make your existing effort sharper, and we point at the gaps you're missing."*
> The judges generated this data; respecting its limits is what earns their trust.

## 4. The five modules

ParkPulse is a **closed loop**: **Detect → Score → Forecast → Deploy → Target.** Here's each link — first the
plain-English version (what you'll say), then the technical version (what you'll say if pushed).

### ① Detect — the hotspot map
**Plain:** We chop the city into a grid of small tiles and count violations in each, so the worst stretches
of road light up on a 3-D map.
**Technical:** We **geohash-encode** every `(lat, lon)` into short base-32 codes at two resolutions —
**~150 m** tiles for fine hotspots and **~1.2 km** for neighbourhoods — then aggregate. Geohash is just a
grid-coordinate system that turns continuous GPS points into discrete, groupable zones.

### ② Score — the Congestion Impact Score (0–100)
**Plain:** Not all violations hurt traffic equally — 100 cars on a footpath is less bad than 100 blocking a
main-road junction. So we combine *how many*, *how bad*, and *how flow-critical* into one 0–100 priority
number per zone.
**Technical:** `impact = violations × average_severity × flow_multiplier`, then log-scaled to 0–100.
- **severity** per violation type (how much it blocks the carriageway): main road = 1.0, near a road crossing
  = 0.9, wrong parking = 0.8, no-parking = 0.6, footpath = 0.5, defective plate = 0.1.
- **flow_multiplier** = `1 + 0.5×(share at a junction) + 0.5×(share on a main road)` — rewards the
  flow-critical spots.
- **Why log-scaled:** counts are heavy-tailed; without the log, a few mega-hotspots would crush every other
  zone to ~0 and the score wouldn't discriminate.
- **Why this shape:** every input only *increases* the score (it's *monotone*), so it's fully **explainable** —
  crucial when you must justify to a citizen or a court *why* you enforced a particular street.

### ③ Forecast — expected violations by zone × weekday × hour
**Plain:** To plan patrols ahead of time, we predict how many violations to expect in each area, for each
weekday and hour, learned from 150 days of history.
**The hard part (say this — it shows depth):** Most zone-weekday-hour combinations are *sparse* — there are
only ~21 Saturdays in the data, so "Zone X, Saturday, 10 AM" might rest on a handful of observations. Naively
averaging those is noisy and unstable.
**Technical:** We use **empirical-Bayes shrinkage**. Analogy: *to estimate a restaurant's Saturday-dinner rush
when you only have a few Saturdays, you blend its actual Saturdays with its overall dinner pattern — trusting
the Saturdays more as you collect more of them.* Formally:

```
rate(zone, weekday, hour) = (count + α · backoff) / (n_weekday + α),   α = 12
```
where `backoff` is the zone's overall rate at that hour across all weekdays. Data-rich cells keep their own
estimate; sparse cells lean on the stable backoff. It's a deliberate **bias-variance trade**: accept a little
bias to kill a lot of noise.

### ④ Deploy — the patrol planner (the hero feature)
**Plain:** Pick a shift (say Saturday 9 AM–1 PM) and how many teams you have (say 8), and ParkPulse instantly
places those teams at the highest-impact spots — *spread across the city* so two teams don't sit on the same
street — and hands you a downloadable plan with expected catches per team.
**Technical:** A **greedy allocation with a spacing constraint**: sort zones by predicted load, walk down the
list, and accept a zone only if it's at least **600 m** (straight-line / Haversine distance) from every team
already placed; stop at K teams. Simple, instant, and explainable.

### ⑤ Target — repeat-offender intelligence
**Plain:** A small group of vehicles offends again and again. We surface that list so enforcement can issue
owner notices or escalate penalties — a few hundred vehicles with outsized impact.
**Technical:** Frequency count over anonymised vehicle tokens, bucketed by how many times each was caught;
the 6+ buckets are the action list. (15% of vehicles → 34% of violations.)

### ⑥ Coverage & ROI — proof that targeting pays
**Plain:** Two things. One, *targeting matters*: a handful of zones hold most of the action, so a few teams
placed well see a big share of violations — and there's a "sweet spot" past which extra teams add little.
Two, the *blind spot*: enforcement is 93% before 1 PM and almost nothing in the evening — a clear gap.
**Technical:** A Pareto/coverage curve — cumulative share of predicted load captured by the top-K zones vs an
even spread; we surface the K where half the violations are concentrated, and the K where the marginal team
adds < 1 percentage point (the staffing sweet spot). Plus enforcement share by hour, with the evening gap flagged.

### ⑦ Ask ParkPulse — the AI co-pilot *(the surprise)*
**Plain:** An officer types (or speaks) in plain English, Hindi or Kannada — *"Plan 6 teams for Friday
evening around KR Market"* — and gets back a **real** deployment plan with a map, instantly.
**Technical:** Google **Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)** with automatic **function-calling** over the *same*
`core.py` functions (`make_patrol_plan`, `top_hotspots`, `coverage_stats`, `repeat_offenders`). The model
decides which tool to call, we run the real computation, and it composes the answer — so every number is
grounded, not generated. It's a true agent, not a chatbot: ask it to deploy teams and it runs the actual
forecaster + optimiser. It's **multilingual** (English / Hindi / Kannada) and lives both as a full
**"Ask ParkPulse"** page *and* as a guardrailed **floating assistant on every page**, so help is one tap away
anywhere in the app.

## 5. Why we built it this way

These are the decisions judges (especially the Flipkart engineers) may probe. Have the *why* ready.

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **Geohash grid** | Turns GPS into groupable zones; hierarchical (zoom in/out); the same trick scales to any city with zero code change. |
| **Empirical-Bayes, not deep learning** | 150 days is too little to train a neural net without overfitting, and a black box is **indefensible** for public enforcement. Shrinkage is interpretable, fast, robust on sparse data. |
| **Transparent, monotone impact score** | A learned/opaque score can't be justified to a citizen or court. Ours can — and its *ranking* is robust to the exact weights. |
| **Greedy patrol with spacing** | Optimal-enough, instant, and explainable; avoids stacking teams on one arterial. |
| **Honest time-split backtest (r = 0.70)** | We refuse to report an inflated in-sample number. Train on the past, predict unseen future weeks — the only honest test. A LightGBM Poisson model scored *lower* (0.69), so we kept the interpretable one. |
| **Streamlit + pydeck** | A *prototype* to prove the intelligence on real data fast, with strong 3-D visuals. The "brain" (`core.py`) is pure Python and decoupled, so production just wraps it in a service — the algorithms don't change. We *proved* this by shipping a second, full-stack build (FastAPI + Next.js / deck.gl) that imports the **same** `core.py`. |
| **Theme 1 over 2 & 3** | We analysed the data: Theme 2 was too thin to support its own ask; Theme 3 is commoditised. Theme 1 was rich *and* played to our forecasting strength. |

**Architecture in one line:** *"We deliberately separated the brain from the face — all the intelligence lives
in one pure-Python module we can test on its own, and the web app is just a thin display layer on top."* The
proof: **two** apps run on it — the Streamlit demo (the submission link) and a finale-grade FastAPI + Next.js /
deck.gl full-stack build — both importing the **same** `app/core.py`.

## 6. Cheat sheet

One-sentence definitions, so you're never caught flat-footed on a term you used.

- **Geohash:** a way to turn a GPS point into a short code for a small grid tile — like a hyper-precise postal code.
- **Congestion Impact Score:** a 0–100 priority per zone = how many violations × how severe × how flow-critical.
- **Severity weight:** how much a violation type blocks moving traffic (main road 1.0 … footpath 0.5).
- **Empirical-Bayes shrinkage:** blending a cell's own sparse history with a broader, stabler average, weighted
  by how much data the cell has.
- **Backtest:** hiding recent data, training on the rest, then grading predictions against the hidden part.
- **Pearson r:** a 0–1 score of how well predictions track reality (1 = perfect); ours is **0.70** on unseen weeks.
- **MAE (mean absolute error):** the average size of the prediction miss (~2 violations per zone-hour cell).
- **Counterfactual replay:** re-running a ParkPulse plan on days the model never saw, to measure what it *would*
  have caught — our proof the system works (see §below: a 10-team plan covers ~38% of logged violations).
- **Observation bias:** the data shows where we *enforce*, not where violations *truly* are.
- **Greedy allocation:** pick the best option, then the next best that isn't too close, and so on.
- **Closed loop:** Detect → Score → Forecast → Deploy → Target, feeding back into itself.

## 7. Judge questions

The most important section. Group answers by theme. Stay calm, agree with the premise where it's fair, then
turn it into a strength.

### Skeptical / challenge questions
**Q: "Isn't this just a heatmap? Our officers already know the hotspots."**
A: Knowing roughly ≠ quantifying, predicting, and acting. Officers know *areas*; we **rank 802 zones by
measured traffic impact**, predict the **specific weekday and hour**, output an **exact deployment plan**, and
flag the **chronic repeat offenders** — and surface the **evening blind spots** you're *not* covering. It turns
tacit knowledge into a shareable, schedulable, auditable system.

**Q: "Your data only reflects where you already enforce — isn't it circular?"** *(the big one)*
A: You're exactly right, and we say so openly in the product itself. We're not claiming to know true parking
demand — we're making your **existing effort more efficient** (more catches per patrol-hour) and **explicitly
flagging the blind spots** (93% of enforcement is before 1 PM; evenings are near-zero). A naive solution hides
this bias; we put it on the front page. Phase 3 closes the loop by fusing live traffic feeds.

**Q: "0.70 correlation isn't very accurate."**
A: Three things. First, it's an **honest** number from a strict time-split — train on the past, predict unseen
future weeks; many teams would quote an inflated in-sample 0.95. (We even tried a LightGBM Poisson model — it
scored *lower* at 0.69, so we kept the interpretable one.) Second, we don't need exact counts — we need the
**right priority order** to deploy teams, and the plan demonstrably lands on the true hotspots. Third, it
**improves** with more data and covariates (weather, events). 0.70 on genuinely unseen weeks is a real,
trustworthy signal — and our held-out replay below proves it converts into real coverage.

**Q: "Aren't the impact-score weights arbitrary?"**
A: They're **transparent, traffic-grounded defaults** (a car blocking a main road matters more than one on a
footpath), and the score is **monotone** — a main-road junction hotspot ranks high under *any* reasonable
weighting, so the *ranking* is robust. They're exposed as tunable parameters for your domain experts — that's
a feature. The alternative, a learned black-box score, would be worse: you couldn't defend it in court.

### Feasibility / deployment
**Q: "Can BTP actually deploy this?"**
A: Yes, today. It uses **only data you already collect** (e-challan), needs **no new sensors or hardware**,
runs on a laptop, and is **live on a public URL right now**. Rollout is three phases: historical exports →
nightly refresh → live ASTraM feed.

**Q: "What does it cost?"**
A: Effectively zero infrastructure — the data exists, and it runs on a laptop or a free cloud tier. The cost is
integration effort, not capital expenditure.

### Scalability
**Q: "Does it work for the whole city / other cities / other violation types?"**
A: Yes — the engine is **geohash-based and city-agnostic**; point it at any region's data, no code change.
Extending from parking to all ASTraM incident types is a configuration change, not a rewrite.

### Technical depth
**Q: "What model — is it deep learning?"**
A: Deliberately not a black box. **Empirical-Bayes shrinkage** — hierarchical historical rates. With 150 days,
a neural net would overfit and, more importantly, be unexplainable for public enforcement. Interpretability is
a requirement here, not a nice-to-have.

**Q: "How do you validate it?"**
A: Two layers. An honest **time-split backtest** — fit on the first 80% of the calendar, predict the held-out
final weeks, score predicted vs actual per zone-weekday-hour: **r = 0.70, MAE ≈ 2.0**. (We benchmarked a
LightGBM Poisson model too — it scored *lower* at 0.69, so we kept the interpretable one.) On top of that, a
**counterfactual replay on 31 held-out days** the model never saw, where a 10-team plan covers ~38% of the
violations actually logged. We never test on training data.

**Q: "Privacy — you're tracking vehicles."**
A: The data is **already anonymised** (plates are tokens like `FKN…`). The repeat-offender module operates on
those tokens; in production it links to RTO/ANPR under the **same legal enforcement authority that already
issues challans** — we just target it smarter.

### Comparison / differentiation
**Q: "Vendors already sell ANPR / enforcement cameras."**
A: Those **detect** violations — a camera problem. We don't detect; we **allocate** — given violations, *where
and when* to send teams. We're complementary, and we use data you already have rather than new camera
infrastructure.

**Q: "What did you build versus take off the shelf?"**
A: We built **all the intelligence** ourselves — the scoring, the forecaster, the optimiser — in plain
pandas/numpy. The off-the-shelf parts are only the visual layer (Streamlit, map and chart libraries) and the
LLM (Gemini) that powers the co-pilot's language understanding. Nothing off-the-shelf does the *thinking* —
the LLM only routes a question to our functions; the actual plan comes from our models.

**Q: "Isn't the AI co-pilot just a gimmick / a wrapper around ChatGPT?"**
A: No — it doesn't *generate* answers, it *calls our models*. Gemini's only job is to understand the question
and pick the right tool (e.g. `make_patrol_plan`); the deployment plan it returns is computed by our real
forecaster and optimiser on the 298K records. Every number is grounded. The value for BTP is **accessibility**
— a field officer can ask in plain Kannada and get an actionable plan, no dashboard training needed.

### Impact
**Q: "How do you know it actually works?"** *(lead with this — it's the proof)*
A: We ran a **counterfactual replay on 31 held-out days the model never saw**. A 10-team ParkPulse plan would
have been positioned for **~38% of the violations actually logged on those days**, versus ~1.3% for teams
spread evenly. Honest framing: that's the share of *catchable/logged* violations (an efficiency number, not
true demand). Against a plain static hotspot heatmap, day-level capture is roughly tied — but ParkPulse adds
the **shift-by-shift timing**, a **ready-to-deploy plan**, and the **co-pilot** on top. It lives in
`core.deployment_simulation()` and surfaces as the validated-impact card on the Coverage & ROI page.

**Q: "What's the measurable benefit?"**
A: More violations caught per patrol-hour (efficiency), proactive instead of reactive scheduling, data-driven
prioritisation replacing instinct, a targeted repeat-offender list, and visibility into under-covered
times/zones. You can measure it directly: catches-per-team-hour and high-impact-zone coverage, before vs after —
and our held-out replay already quantifies it at **~38% coverage** for a 10-team plan.

## 8. Demo walkthrough

What to click and the one key line for each page (mirrors `pitch/VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`; use it live too).

1. **Command Center** — *"298,000 real violations; the worst 1% of locations carry a third of them. And notice:
   93% are logged before 1 PM — that's when patrols are out, not when parking peaks. We're honest about that."*
   Rotate the 3-D map.
2. **Hotspot Explorer** — filter to "Parking in a main road" / change the hour → *"We don't just count tickets,
   we score them by traffic impact, and the ranking updates live."*
3. **Forecast & Patrol Planner** — set Saturday, 9–1, 8 teams → *"In two seconds: eight deployment points,
   spread across the city, each with its expected catches. Download, brief the teams. Reactive becomes
   proactive."* Point at the honest **r = 0.70**.
4. **Coverage & ROI** — *"And here's the proof it works: replayed on 31 days the model never saw, a 10-team
   plan would have been on ~38% of the violations actually logged — versus 1.3% spread evenly."*
5. **Repeat-Offender Intelligence** — *"15% of vehicles cause 34% of violations — here's the target list."*
6. **Ask ParkPulse + the floating assistant** — type *"Plan 6 teams for Friday evening around KR Market"* (in
   English, Hindi or Kannada) → a real plan with a map appears. *"The same co-pilot floats on every page."*

Then close on the Command Center map with the north-star sentence.

> **Mention the full-stack build:** the live link above is the Streamlit demo; there's also a finale-grade
> **FastAPI + Next.js / deck.gl** version (same `core.py` brain) with the six pages, the floating in-app
> assistant, and the multilingual co-pilot — proof the intelligence ports cleanly to production.

## 9. Numbers to memorize

Keep these on the tip of your tongue:
- **298,445** violations · **150 days** (Nov 2023–Apr 2024) · ~**1,990/day**
- Top **1%** of locations = **33%** of all violations
- **168** named junctions · **802** neighbourhood zones
- **15%** of vehicles → **34%** of violations
- **~93%** of enforcement before 1 PM · **<0.3%** in the 5–9 PM evening peak
- Forecast accuracy **r = 0.70**, MAE ≈ **2.0**, on **held-out** weeks (a LightGBM Poisson model scored 0.69)
- Validated impact: a 10-team plan covers **~38%** of violations on **31 held-out days** (vs 1.3% spread evenly)
- Impact Score **0–100** · severity from **1.0** (main road) to **0.1** (defective plate)

---

## 10. Honest limitations — own them first

State these *before* a judge raises them; it signals maturity.
1. **Observation bias** — the data is enforcement time, not true demand. *Our framing:* efficiency + blind-spot
   flagging; Phase-3 fix is live-feed fusion.
2. **Impact is a proxy** — there's no congestion sensor in the data, so the Impact Score is a transparent,
   defensible *estimate*, not a measurement. *Fix:* validate it against ASTraM speed/flow data.
3. **Forecast is moderate (r = 0.70)** — honest on a clean split; improves with weather/event covariates. It
   still converts into real coverage: a held-out replay puts a 10-team plan on ~38% of logged violations.
4. **Repeat offenders are anonymised tokens** — production links to RTO/ANPR for real notices.

The meta-message: *"We know exactly what this prototype does and doesn't do — and we've designed the next two
phases to close those gaps."*

---

## 11. Pitch at three lengths

- **30 seconds (elevator):** *"Illegal parking chokes Bengaluru and enforcement is reactive — officers go on
  instinct. ParkPulse reads your 298,000 parking-violation records and tells you where the worst hotspots are,
  when they'll recur, and exactly how to deploy your teams — plus the chronic repeat offenders. It runs today,
  on data you already have. It turns what already happened into where to stand tomorrow."*

- **2 minutes:** §1 (problem + what it is + the **~38% held-out proof**) → the closed loop (§4, one line each) →
  the honesty insight (§3) → the patrol planner as the payoff → "feasible today, scales to a live feed." Close
  on the north-star line.

- **5 minutes:** the full §2 story (why Theme 1) → §3 data + the observation-bias insight → live demo of the six
  pages (§8) → the **validated-impact card (~38% on 31 held-out days)** → §5 the key technical choices
  (empirical Bayes, honest backtest r = 0.70, explainable score) → the full-stack build + multilingual co-pilot
  → §10 limitations + 3-phase rollout → close.

*Study §7 hardest — that's where pitches are won or lost. Everything else you can read off the screen; the
tough questions you have to own.*
